Note About University Photographers
===================================

Elmer S. Gardner was our University photographer from 1904 to 1907.  The photos he took while on staff have the ISC logo--where the letters are all on top of each other—and a G next to them.  I believe this is the same Gardner, working as a private individual in Des Moines.  There are a number of photos with this signature also.

During the time Gardner was on our staff, many pictures were taken of campus dwellings, faculty families, farm activities—including the Campanile and sheep image.  I kind of feel like he was hired specifically to do a thorough documentation of the college, but have never run across any documentation of this.

There are personnel folders for two other campus photographers—F.E. Colburn and E.A. Richardson—in RS 5/2/2.  They also used the ISC insignia, with a C for Colburn and an R for Richardson.  Richardson was the one who took those 4-H pictures that are in shapes.

Unfortunately, we have no personnel file on this person, whose name was S. Percy Dean.  However, I’ve found him listed in the Directory as Photographer with Information Service.  He first appears in 1951/52, and his last entry is in 1958/59. [Use Percy Dean, as this seems to be the name he commonly went by.]
